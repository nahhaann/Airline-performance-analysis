## Airline Performance Analysis

##📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes real-world airline performance data sourced from data.gov.in, focusing on Descriptive and Diagnostic Analysis to understand flight delays and operational efficiency. The aim is to summarize key performance metrics, identify root causes of delays, and provide actionable recommendations for improvement.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Descriptive Analysis – Summarize airline performance metrics such as on-time percentage, delay frequency, and average delay duration.

- Diagnostic Analysis – Identify and explain the main factors contributing to delays (e.g., weather conditions, technical issues, airport congestion).

## 📊 Key Insights
- Descriptive Analysis: Identified peak delay periods by month, day, and time.

- Diagnostic Analysis: Found seasonal and operational factors influencing delays, including weather patterns and route congestion.

- Descriptive Analysis: Highlighted airlines with the best and worst on-time performance.

- Diagnostic Analysis: Uncovered links between specific airports and higher delay rates.

## 📈 Deliverables
- Descriptive Analysis Dashboards in Power BI summarizing key performance trends.

- Diagnostic Analysis Reports explaining root causes of delays.

- Visual reports for decision-making support.

## 🏁 Conclusion
The Airline Performance Analysis project applies Descriptive and Diagnostic Analysis to provide a clear picture of airline operational performance and flight delays. By identifying both what is happening (descriptive) and why it’s happening (diagnostic), the study delivers actionable insights that can help airlines improve punctuality, optimize resources, and enhance passenger satisfaction.
